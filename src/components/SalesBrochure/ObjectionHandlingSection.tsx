      response: "You're investing in premium dedicated infrastructure, not shared pools. While our per-mailbox cost is $1.50, our total cost of ownership is often lower because of our $15.55 setup fee vs competitors charging $300+. Plus, our 4x higher deliverability rates mean you need fewer mailboxes to achieve the same results."

While you're evaluating, remember we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can test our service risk-free alongside any comparisons."

      icon: "üîß",
      title: "Our current solution is working fine",
      response: "That's great to hear. What inbox delivery rates are you currently seeing? Most teams we work with were getting 60-80% before switching to us and now consistently see 99%+. Even a 20% improvement in deliverability can double your response rates. Would a quick deliverability audit be valuable?"
    },

      icon: "üîí",
      title: "We need to involve IT/Security team first",
      response: "Absolutely, security is crucial. We're built on Microsoft Azure with SOC 2 certification and enterprise-grade security. I can provide our security documentation and schedule a technical call with your IT team. Most security reviews take 2-3 days. Would you like me to send our security brief now?"
    },
    {
      icon: "üìä",
      title: "We don't send enough volume to justify this",
      response: "Our minimum is 50 mailboxes, which works for teams sending as few as 5,000 emails per month. At $75/month total cost, you're looking at $0.015 per email vs potential lost revenue from poor deliverability. What's your current monthly send volume?"
    },
    {
      icon: "‚öôÔ∏è",
      title: "This seems too technical for our team",
      response: "That's exactly why our customers love us - zero technical work required. We handle 100% of the setup, authentication, and maintenance. Your team just logs into Outlook and starts sending. No DNS changes, no technical expertise needed. It's designed for RevOps teams, not IT departments."
    },
    {
      icon: "üè¢",
      title: "We're already locked into a contract with our current provider",
      response: "I understand contract commitments. What's your renewal date? Many clients start planning 90 days before renewal since switching takes only 3 hours. In the meantime, we can run a deliverability audit to show exactly what you're missing. When does your current contract expire?"

    },
    {
      icon: "üéØ",
      title: "We've been burned by email providers before",
      response: "I completely understand that concern. What went wrong with your previous provider? Our approach is different - dedicated infrastructure means no shared reputation issues, and our 3-hour setup means you're not investing weeks only to be disappointed. Plus our 30-day guarantee eliminates the risk."
    },

      icon: "üì±",
      title: "This sounds too good to be true",
      response: "I appreciate the healthy skepticism. Let me share some specific client results: [Company X] went from 65% to 99% inbox delivery in 48 hours. [Company Y] doubled their reply rates in the first month. I can connect you with similar clients in your industry for references. Would that help?"
    },
    {
      icon: "‚ö°",
      title: "We need this implemented faster than your timeline",
      response: "We typically complete setup in 3 hours, but I understand urgent needs. What's driving the rush? If you have a critical campaign launching, we can prioritize your setup and potentially have you live within 24 hours. What's your exact deadline?"
    },
    {
      icon: "üîÑ",
      title: "We just implemented a new email solution",
      response: "How's it performing so far? What inbox delivery rates are you seeing? Sometimes new implementations take time to show their true performance. If you're not seeing 95%+ inbox delivery within 30 days, there might be fundamental infrastructure issues. Would you like a quick audit to benchmark against industry standards?"

      response: "Absolutely, legal review is important for enterprise decisions. Our standard MSA has been approved by Fortune 500 legal teams. I can send our contract template now to expedite their review. Most legal reviews take 5-7 business days. Should I send it over?"
    },
    {

      title: "We're too busy to implement something new right now",

Your team keeps working while we set everything up in the background. What would need to change for this to become a priority?"
